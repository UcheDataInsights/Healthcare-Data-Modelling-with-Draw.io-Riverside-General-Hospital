# 🏥 Healthcare Data Warehouse & Analytics Model


## 🧩 Project Overview  
A modern Healthcare Data Warehouse designed to power hospital performance analytics and strategic decision-making.  
This model adopts a **Star Schema** architecture — enabling fast, scalable, and integrated insight generation across core healthcare dimensions: Doctors, Patients, Procedures, Dates, and Locations.


## 🎯 Objective  
Transform fragmented operational datasets into a **centralized analytics ecosystem** that improves:

✔️ Revenue & cost visibility  
✔️ Operational performance tracking  
✔️ Patient outcome monitoring  
✔️ Data governance & reporting scalability  

---

## 📊 Dashboard & Analytics Focus  
Optimized for key BI initiatives, including:

- Workflow & process optimization  
- Care delivery performance tracking  
- Department accountability visualization  
- Real-time decision support analytics  
- Insightable drill-down paths for executives & clinical teams
